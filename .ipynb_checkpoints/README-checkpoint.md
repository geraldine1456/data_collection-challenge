<b style="font-size:20px;"> DATA COLLECTION-CHALLENGE</b>

<b>Description:</b>
This challenge focuses on applying web-scraping and data analysis skills to gather, process, and interpret data from online sources. The objective is to enhance capabilities in data collection, organization, and visualization to derive meaningful insights.

Key Insights:</b>
•	Number of months on Mars: 12
•	Total Martian days of data available: 1867
•	Temperature Trends: Mars experiences significant temperature variations, with the coldest month being Month 3 (-83.31°C) and a warming trend peaking at    Month 8 (-68.38°C).
•	Atmospheric Pressure Trends: Atmospheric pressure fluctuates, reaching a minimum in Month 6 (745.05 Pa) and a peak in Month 9 (913.31 Pa).
•	Martian Year Length: Temperature cycles suggest that a Martian year spans approximately 687 Earth days, aligning with known scientific data.

<b><b>Outputs:</b>
•	Organized list of Mars news titles and previews (mars_news.json)
•	A structured Mars weather data file (mars_data.csv)
•	Bar charts for temperature and pressure trends across Martian months   
•	Visualization estimating the length of a Martian year in Earth days
 
<b>Tools and Libraries </b>
•	Web scraping: Splinter, Beautiful Soup 
•	Data handling: Pandas

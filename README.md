# DATA COLLECTION-CHALLENGE

## Description:
### This challenge focuses on applying web-scraping and data analysis skills to gather, process, and interpret data from online sources. The objective is to enhance capabilities in data collection, organization, and visualization to derive meaningful insights.

### The project is divided into two parts, each producing a distinct deliverable:
1.	__Mars News Scraper__: Scrape titles and preview text of news articles from the Mars News website. Script (part_1_mars_news.ipynb)
2.	__Mars Weather Data Analysis__: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data from an HTML table. Script (part_2_mars_weather.ipynb)

## Key Insights:
-   Number of months on Mars: 12
-   Total Martian days of data available: 1867
-   Temperature Trends: Mars experiences significant temperature variations, with the coldest month being Month 3 (-83.31°C) and a     warming trend peaking at Month 8 (-68.38°C).  
-   Atmospheric Pressure Trends: Atmospheric pressure fluctuates, reaching a minimum in Month 6 (745.05 Pa) and a peak in Month 9 (913.31 Pa).  
-   Martian Year Length: Temperature cycles suggest that a Martian year spans approximately 687 Earth days, aligning with known scientific data.  

## Outputs:
-   Organized list of Mars news titles and previews (mars_news.json)
-   A structured Mars weather data file (mars_data.csv)
-   Bar charts for temperature and pressure trends across Martian months   
-   Visualization estimating the length of a Martian year in Earth days
 
## Tools and Libraries 
-   Web scraping: Splinter, Beautiful Soup 
-   Data handling: Pandas
-   Visualization: Matplotlib
